          <h1> GLOBAL WARMING </h1>
          <p> Global warming is the long-term heating of Earth's surface observed since the pre-industrial period (between 1850 and 1900) <br>due to human activities,primarily fossil fuel burning which increases heat-trapping Greenhouse gas levels in Earth's atmosphere. <br>This term is not interchangeable with the term "climate change".</p>

        <p class="globe3">Afghanistan. Between 1950 and 2020, the temperatures in Afghanistan increased by 1.8ºC, and an optimistic view of the climate crisis in the country still shows a minimum increase of 1.4°C by 2050 (the worst case scenario would see a 6ºC increase by the end of this century)</p>

        <h2>Afforestation</h2>
        <p>A single tree will absorb one ton of carbon dioxide over its lifetime.</p>
        <h2>Recycle</h2>
        <p>We can save 2,400 pounds of carbon dioxide per year by recycling just half of your household waste.</p>
        <h2>Turn off appliances</h2>
        <p>Simply turning off your television, DVD player, and computer, when you're not using them, will save you thousands of pounds of carbon dioxide a year.</p>
        <h2>Usage of Solar panels</h2>
        <p>Using the power of the sun rather than electricity allows us to harness energy rather than waste energy.</p>
        <h2>Public Transportation</h2>
        <p>Usage of Public Transporation leads to decrease of carbon monoxide[CO] which are emitted by Vechiles.</p>
